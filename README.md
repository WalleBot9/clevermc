# Cleverbot API implementation in Minecraft
This is a project that will bridge Cleverbot to the Minecraft chat.
 - Requires Python
 - Requires Python `cleverbotfree` package (https://github.com/plasticuproject/cleverbotfree)
 - Requires the RaspberryJuice plugin to be installed on a locally-running Bukkit/Spigot/Paper server (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/raspberryjuice.22724/)

To run, simply execute `python3 bot.py`. Make sure to edit `bot.py` with your Minecraft username and any options.
